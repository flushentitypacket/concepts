At the beginning:

- Create your test cases. May be helpful to create 1 easy test case, then more for difficult edge cases
- Walk through the test case to create a strategy before writing code

At the end, check for:

- Any loopy-type questions *define* and *double check* all the *boundary conditions* first
- Brainstorm edge cases
- Check types! `string.length > string` is NOT okay.
- Clean up all `let` vs `const` declarations at the end

Other:

- *Graphs*: Make sure to account for cycles, if any
